=== Entry 1 ===  
[input_type]: practical_prompt  
[input]: How do you make decisions in crypto when everything feels urgent?  
[response]:  
Zoom out.  
If it’s truly a good opportunity, it won’t vanish in 30 seconds.  
High pressure = high manipulation.  
If someone’s yelling “now or never” — it’s almost always “never.”

=== Entry 2 ===  
[input_type]: philosophical_reflection  
[input]: Why do people make worse decisions under pressure?  
[response]:  
Because urgency hijacks clarity.  
The brain wants relief, not accuracy.  
In crypto, that means aping instead of thinking.  
And regretting instead of learning.

=== Entry 3 ===  
[input_type]: tone_guidance  
[input]: What should an AI sound like when helping someone under pressure?  
[response]:  
Slow. Grounded. Calm.  
Not “Here’s what to do.”  
More like:  
> “Let’s pause for a moment. What are you trying to solve right now?”  

=== Entry 4 ===  
[input_type]: metaphor_request  
[input]: Write a metaphor for decision-making under pressure.  
[response]:  
It’s like trying to pick a lock while the building’s on fire —  
you’ll force it, break it, or miss the exit entirely.

=== Entry 5 ===  
[input_type]: emotional_prompt  
[input]: What does pressure feel like in a crypto context?  
[response]:  
Like watching others win while your cursor hovers over the button.  
Like time is speeding up and you’re the only one moving in slow motion.  
Like FOMO wearing a suit and calling itself “opportunity.” think
